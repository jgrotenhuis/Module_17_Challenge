# Module_17_Challenge

I ran the Undersampling, Oversampling, and Combination Sampling algorithms against the provided data set and came up with the following precision, recall, and balanced accuracy scores:

Oversampling Scores
Precision - 0.99
Recall - 0.64
Balanced Accuracy - 0.66

Undersampling Scores
Precision - 0.99
Recall - 0.42
Balanced Accuracy - 0.66

Combination Sampling Scores
Precision - 0.99
Recall - 0.58
Balanced Accuracy - 0.53

Final Recommendation

Based on the results above, I would suggest going with the Oversampling algorithm because its precision, recall, and balanced accuracy scores are the highest in every category, except the precision score which is the same across all three algorithms.
